Split `grid_size` to the `threads`.

`strategy` is passed to [`Scotch.strat_flags`](https://keluaa.github.io/Scotch.jl/dev/#Scotch.strat_flags).

`workload_tolerance` is the acceptable workload uneveness among the partitions.
Giving a few blocks of margin (e.g. at least `1/prod(grid_size)`) is preferrable.

`weighted == true` will distribute blocks while taking into account the number of real cells they have.
In this case all parameters of the grid must be present: `static_sized_grid`, `block_size`,
`remainder_block_size` and `ghosts` must be given (obtained with e.g. [`grid_dimensions`](@ref)).

The partitioning is random, hence results may vary. To counterbalance this, giving `retries > 0` will
repeat the partitioning `retries` times and keep the best one.
